	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p> Gary McKinnon is an alleged hacker from Scotland, UK. He was accused of hacking into 97 US Government computers from February 2001 to March 2002.
	    Looking for evidence of UFOs that he suspected the US Government was concealing from the public, McKinnon moved laterally across Federal networks
		and escalated his priviledges in order to search for anything he could find regarding UFOs. Eventually he was caught, and underwent a decade long
		legal battle. Ultimately he appealed to the UK government, who denied extradition to the United States on the basis of his Asperger's Syndrome.
		McKinnon, in the end, was not prosecuted.
