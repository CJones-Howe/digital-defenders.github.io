	<h2>Apprehension and Legal Battle</h2>
	<p> McKinnon faced a ten year legal battle with the United States from overseas. Through the created emails tied to software downloads and IP residue left from the spree, McKinnon was traced to the United Kingdom. McKinnon was facing up to 70 years in jail as well as "millions in fines". Between February 2001 and March 2002 Gary hacked into "97 military and NASA computers". At one point, he took down the army’s entire Washington DC network for three days, and their network was scaled to about 2000 computers. McKinnon's arrest was dated on March 19th, 2002, by the UKs National Hi-Tech Crime Unit, and it was only an uphill battle from there on. His charges on damaged data and computers tallied to $700,000 followed with a risk of 70 years in a United States prison if convicted. 10 years later in 2012 the charges were dropped due to Britain believing that McKinnon was dealing with mental health issues such as suicide, deeming that he would not get a fair trial.
