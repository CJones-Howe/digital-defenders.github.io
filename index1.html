<h2>Who is Gary McKinnon?</h2>
<div class="introduction">
	<li>Gary McKinnon is a Scottish man born in Glascow in 1966.</li>
	<li>McKinnon became interested in computers at the age of 14, when he was given an Atari 400 game console. He used this device to learn the coding language "Basic."</li>
	<li>McKinnon dropped out of High School at 17 and became a hair dresser, also finding sporadic work in the world of Tech Support.</li>
	<li>He claims that he had a UFO encounter, which sparked his deep interest in UFOs and with finding the truth about them.</li>
	<li>McKinnon believed that the US Government was concealing evidence of UFOs, Alien acitivity, and free energy. This is what motivated him to execute his hacks.</li>

<h2>Reconaissance of Federal Networks</h2>
	<p>McKinnon had been expirementing with computers and hacking since the 1980s, and by the early 2000s was proficient enough to know his way around a computer
	   system and knew how to navigate networks. Addition to his hobbiest experience he had also read "The Hacker's Handbook," taken some computer courses, and
	   had done some contracting work in the tech industry.</p>
	<p>It is not uncommon for hackers to benignly poke around in networks and systems that they can find weaknesses in while simply perusing public networks,
	   however McKinnon's efforts against NASA were a purposeful and targeted effort with the goal of executing a data exclusivity violation. This truly was
	   a cyber-attack, and it began with McKinnon using a dial-up modem to connect to the internet and scan blocks of publically available IPs for the NASA
	   Johnson Space Center.</p>
	<p>McKinnon scanned on the 134 port, a port commonly used for file-sharing and print-sharing. If he could find a public-facing IP address at the Space Center
	   that had improperly configured this port and left it without proper credential requirements, he could exploit that weakness to gain access to that specific
	   machine and perhaps the entire network it was attached to. This is exactly what he did. Though the exact tool he used to execute this reconaissance is unknown,
	   it is likely that it was a tool similar to the NMAP tool for linux, which is commonly used today for similar purposes.
