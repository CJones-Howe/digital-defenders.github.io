	<h2>Attack Significance</h2>
	<p> 97 total attacks made by just one person is an absurd number to think of in any business, but 97 total attacks in a year to the United States government is another thing. Although the timeline was in the early 2000's and technology was somewhat new to everyone, the United States government showed a ton of vulnerabilities in their systems totaling every branch in their defense. McKinnon wiggled through the governments "security" through a little knowledge he learned with his computer obsession. The attack highlighted a lot of serious issues within the systems the United States uses. Without top notch firewalls and layers of security McKinnon showed how easy it was to see specific data and delete certain stuff from his house, on the bigger scale we can only imagine what other countries could do. McKinnon opened the eyes of a lot of people to question the government about UFO's as well as how secure ones government is.
