	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p> Gary McKinnon was very smart during his cyber attacks, but did leave a small trail of evidence behind. When relating this certain attack to "MITRE ATT&CK" you can see many resemblances in many branches of the noted attacks. Gary fell under the "Initial Access", "Privilege Escalation", and "Persistence" branches. Gary left a cocky message under one of the computers saying "Your security system is crap" which falls under "Data Manipulation". Gary also had remote access during his attacks which ties to "Lateral Movement" as well. "Persistence" and  "Privilege Escalation" can also be seen through his work of exploiting into the system through its vulnerabilities backing up with "Persistence"; booting up files.
