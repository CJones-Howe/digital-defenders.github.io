<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<div class= "conclusion">
	McKinnon's case is an old, yet still very famous one in the wider hacking community. The main reason why McKinnon remains known as the infamous "UFO Hacker"
	is because what he did is so extreme, and his motivation so bizarre. Its an example of how truly important it is to take all aspects of security seriously.
	Most inviduals would never dream of attempting to breach a government network, but McKinnon shows us just how effective one properly motivated individual can be.
	Though many individuals likely view his actions as harmless, McKinnon's actions were and still are highly illegal. Under no circumstances should any individual
	attempt to immitate his behavior. Despite the length of his legal battle, McKinnon was lucky to not be prosecuted.
